#### `ls -l` long listing
  - If the entry in the first column is a d, then the row in the table corresponds to a directory, otherwise the information in the row corresponds to a file

#### Output redirection and appending
  - Output redirection stores text that would be normally printed to the command line in a text file. You can use output redirection by typing the greater-than sign (>) at the end of a command followed by the name of the new file that will contain the output from the proceeding command.
  - Example: `echo "I'm in the file." > echo-out.txt`

  - You can also append text to the end of a file using two greater-than signs (>>). 
  - Example: `echo "I have been appended." >> echo-out.txt`
